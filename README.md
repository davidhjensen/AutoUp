# AutoUp: An Automated Techpack Generator
This project provides functionality to automatically generate product mockups for sales reps. This is done (for now) through a local HTML form that is parsed and used to generate a mockup using JavaScript.
For now, run `test_form_read.js` by running `node test_form_read.js`. Then, fill out `form_v2.html` in `forms/`. The generated techpack is saved to `function/techpack.pdf`.
